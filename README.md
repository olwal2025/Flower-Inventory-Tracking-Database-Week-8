# Flower-Inventory-Tracking-Database-Week-8

## Description

This project is a complete database management system for tracking flower inventory, designed and implemented using only MySQL. It demonstrates the creation of a well-structured relational database for a real-world use case; managing the inventory of flowers in a shop or warehouse.

## Features

- Relational database design for flower inventory tracking
- Tables with proper constraints: Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, NOT NULL, UNIQUE
- Implementation of relationships: One-to-One, One-to-Many and Many-to-Many where appropriate
